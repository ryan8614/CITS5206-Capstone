# Tests Handover Document

## Overview

The `tests` directory contains automated tests for key backend and authentication features of the application. These tests are written in TypeScript and are designed to be run with a compatible test runner (such as Jest or similar frameworks).

---

## Test Files

### 1. `auth.test.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Tests the authentication logic, including sign-in and sign-up flows.

**Typical Coverage:**  
- Valid and invalid login attempts
- Registration with valid and invalid data
- Error handling for authentication failures

---

### 2. `middleware.test.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Tests the custom middleware logic, ensuring that requests are properly authenticated and authorized.

**Typical Coverage:**  
- Access control for protected routes
- Session validation
- Redirection or error responses for unauthorized access

---

### 3. `session.test.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Tests the session management utilities in `src/lib/session.tsx`.

**Typical Coverage:**  
- Session creation and validation
- Expiry and invalidation logic
- User context extraction

---

### 4. `session_route.test.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Tests the `/api/session` endpoint.

**Typical Coverage:**  
- Correctly reports login status
- Handles missing or invalid sessions gracefully

---

### 5. `upload_route.test.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Tests the file upload endpoint and related logic.

**Typical Coverage:**  
- Accepts valid file uploads
- Rejects invalid file types or oversized files
- Handles upload errors

---

## General Notes

- All tests are written in TypeScript.
- The tests are intended to be run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline or manually during development.
- Ensure that the backend and any required services (e.g., database) are running before executing the tests.
- Update or add new tests when modifying backend logic or adding new features to maintain coverage and reliability.

---

## Recommendations for Future Developers

- **Test Coverage:** Add tests for any new endpoints or business logic.
- **Consistency:** Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions.
- **Maintenance:** Regularly update tests to reflect changes in application logic or data models.
- **Documentation:** Comment complex test cases for clarity.
