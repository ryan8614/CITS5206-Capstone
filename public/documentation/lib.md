# Lib Handover Document

## Overview

The `src/lib` directory contains utility modules and core logic that support data processing, session management, and business logic for the application. These files are typically imported by API routes, server actions, or React components to encapsulate reusable logic.

---

## File Summaries

### 1. `definitions.ts`

**Purpose:**  
Defines TypeScript types, interfaces, and constants used throughout the application.  
**Usage:**  
Import shared types from this file to ensure type safety and consistency across modules.

---

### 2. `loadFilteredContacts.ts`

**Purpose:**  
Contains logic to load and filter contact data.  
**Usage:**  
Used by features/pages that need to display or process filtered contact lists, such as department-specific contact tables.

---

### 3. `loadFilteredStudents.ts`

**Purpose:**  
Handles loading and filtering of student data, similar to the contacts module.  
**Usage:**  
Used in student management features to fetch and filter student lists by department or other criteria.

---

### 4. `parseExcelAndSave.ts`

**Purpose:**  
Implements logic to parse uploaded Excel files and save their contents to the backend.  
**Usage:**  
Called by upload endpoints or actions when users upload Excel files, ensuring data is extracted and persisted correctly.

---

### 5. `session.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Manages user session logic, such as authentication, session validation, or user context.  
**Usage:**  
Imported by authentication middleware, API routes, or React components that need to check or manage user sessions.

---

## General Notes

- All files are written in TypeScript for type safety.
- Utility modules in this folder are designed to be imported wherever their logic is needed, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.
- When adding new utilities or core logic, place them in this folder and document their purpose and usage.

---

## Recommendations for Future Developers

- **Type Safety:** Always define and import types from `definitions.ts` to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep business logic in `src/lib` and UI logic in components/pages.
- **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and types for maintainability.
- **Testing:** Ensure utility functions are covered by unit tests in the `/tests` directory.
