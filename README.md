# CITS5206-Capstone

Information Technology Capstone Project -- SEM 1 2025

# Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to synchronize their Excel files on a web page. The application is built with Next.js. Users can select an Excel file and upload it, and the application will read the data from the Excel file and present it on the front-end page. Users can edit the file content on the front-end page, and the changed content will be synchronized to all files on the back-end. The application provides a download link for the modified file.

### Technical architecture

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project Tailwinded with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
