## Project Overview:
This project aims to streamline the process of tracking staff and office room changes within clients' organization. Currently, updates are managed manually across two separate documents, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. Human errors during cross-checking often result in missing or outdated contact information.

To improve accuracy and efficiency, the goal is to link the spreadsheet containing office room assignments with the contact list. This integration ensures the contact list is always up to date and ready for printing. 

By automating this process, we reduce administrative workload, eliminate manual syncing, and maintain a reliable, always-current contact directory.

## Features
1. User authorization before accessing the data
2. Automated Syncing for updates
3. Print-Ready Output
