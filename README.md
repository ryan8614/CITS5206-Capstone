# CITS5206-Capstone

Information Technology Capstone Project -- SEM 1 2025

# Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to synchronize their Excel files with a Google Sheets document. The application is built using Next.js and Google Sheets API. The user can select an Excel file and a Google Sheets document, and the application will read the data from the Excel file and write it to the Google Sheets document. The user can also select a specific range of cells in the Excel file to synchronize, and the application will only write the selected range of cells to the Google Sheets document.

### Technical architecture

üìå User operation process
1Ô∏è‚É£ User uploads fileA.xlsx
2Ô∏è‚É£ System reads fileA.xlsx and updates fileB.xlsx
3Ô∏è‚É£ User downloads updated fileB.xlsx

üìå System architecture
Frontend: Next.js (user uploads Excel)
Backend: Vercel Serverless (Node.js + Express)
Storage: AWS S3 / Google Drive (store Excel)
Database: No database required, directly process Excel file

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
