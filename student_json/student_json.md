# Student JSON Handover Document

## Overview

The `student_json` directory contains the raw data and scripts used to extract and preprocess student information from Excel files provided by the client. This data is then converted into JSON format for use within the application.

---

## Contents

- **raw_data.xlsx**  
  The original Excel file(s) received from the client, containing student data across multiple sheets.

- **data_transfer.py**  
  A Python script used to extract, clean, and convert the Excel data into a structured JSON format.

- **students_data.json**  
  The output JSON file generated by the script, containing all processed student data, organized by sheet.

## Workflow

1. **Manual Extraction:**  
   The client provides the raw Excel file (`raw_data.xlsx`). Any necessary manual cleaning (such as removing completely blank rows) is performed before processing.

2. **Python Script Processing:**  
   The `data_transfer.py` script is run to:
   - Read each sheet from the Excel file.
   - Clean and format the data (e.g., convert dates, handle missing values).
   - Convert the cleaned data into a list of dictionaries for each sheet.
   - Save the combined data as `students_data.json`.

3. **JSON Output:**  
   The resulting `students_data.json` file is used as a data source for the application, enabling efficient loading and filtering of student information.
